## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.1] - 2025-10-29

### Changed
- Refactored error handling to use V4_ERR() macro for improved code readability
  - Replaced 68 instances of `static_cast<v4_err>(Err::XXX)` with shorter `V4_ERR(XXX)` macro
  - No runtime cost - compiler generates identical machine code
  - Reduced source code verbosity by ~1200 characters

## [0.4.0] - 2025-10-29

  - LOAD8U (0x32), LOAD16U (0x33): Unsigned 8/16-bit loads
  - STORE8 (0x34), STORE16 (0x35): 8/16-bit stores
  - LOAD8S (0x36), LOAD16S (0x37): Signed 8/16-bit loads with sign extension
- Control flow and compact literal operations:
  - SELECT (0x43): Ternary operator (flag b a SELECT → flag ? a : b)

  - LIT_U8 (0x76), LIT_I8 (0x77), LIT_I16 (0x78): Compact immediate values
- Local variable support:
  - Frame pointer (fp) added to VM structure
  - LGET (0x79), LSET (0x7A), LTEE (0x7B): General local variable access
  - LGET0 (0x7C), LGET1 (0x7D), LSET0 (0x7E), LSET1 (0x7F): Optimized local access
  - LINC (0x80), LDEC (0x81): Local variable increment/decrement
- Comprehensive test coverage for all 31 new opcodes

### Changed
- Local variables stored in return stack with frame pointer for efficient access

### Added (Build System)
- V4_ENABLE_LTO option to enable Link Time Optimization (default: OFF)
  - 35% size reduction in core VM code (23KB → 15KB stripped) when enabled
  - IPO (Interprocedural Optimization) support detection via CheckIPOSupported
  - Note: LTO is not compatible with sanitizers (AddressSanitizer, UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer)

## [0.3.0] - 2025-10-28

### Added
- REPL support APIs for interactive programming:
  - vm_reset_dictionary: Reset word dictionary while preserving stacks
  - vm_reset_stacks: Reset stacks while preserving dictionary
  - vm_ds_push, vm_ds_pop, vm_ds_clear: Direct stack manipulation APIs
  - vm_ds_snapshot, vm_ds_restore, vm_ds_snapshot_free: Stack snapshot/restore for preserving state across VM operations
- Comprehensive test coverage for all new REPL APIs
- Arena memory allocator for embedded systems:
  - Linear bump allocator without individual free
  - Alignment support for various data types
  - v4_arena_init, v4_arena_alloc, v4_arena_reset APIs
  - Eliminates need for malloc/free in constrained environments
- Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) for embedded platforms:
  - GPIO API: pin initialization, read/write
  - UART API: serial communication (init, putc, getc)
  - Timer API: milliseconds/microseconds, delays
  - System API: reset and platform info
- SYS instruction (0x60) for HAL access from bytecode:
  - 10 system call IDs for GPIO, UART, and Timer operations
  - Stack-based parameter passing
  - Error code returns for all operations
- Mock HAL implementation for unit testing
- Comprehensive documentation (hal-api.md, sys-opcodes.md)

### Changed
- vm_reset now implemented as vm_reset_dictionary + vm_reset_stacks for better modularity
- All test targets now link with mock_hal for HAL function resolution
- VmConfig now includes optional arena field for memory management
- vm_register_word uses arena allocator when available (falls back to malloc)
- vm_destroy and vm_reset_dictionary skip free() when using arena
- Word name memory is now managed by arena or malloc depending on configuration
- CMakeLists.txt reorganized with clear sections and better structure
- Build system now uses helper function for test targets to reduce repetition
- Added project version to CMake configuration (0.2.1)
- Improved include directory handling with generator expressions

### Removed
- v4repl tool (moved to separate repository)

### Fixed
- Arena alignment test failure on macOS by ensuring test buffer is 16-byte aligned
- Memory leak in test_vm when using vm_register_word without cleanup (detected by AddressSanitizer)

### Added (Build System)
- V4_BUILD_TOOLS option to control tool building (default: ON)
- V4_ENABLE_MOCK_HAL option to control mock HAL inclusion (default: ON)
- V4_OPTIMIZE_SIZE option to control size optimization (default: ON)
- CMake configuration summary displayed during configuration
- Installation targets for library and headers
- V4::mock_hal alias target for easier linking

### Added (CI/CD)
- Build options matrix CI job to test all CMake option combinations
- Tests for minimal builds (library-only configurations)
- Tests for size-optimized vs non-optimized builds
- Verification of all new CMake options (V4_BUILD_TOOLS, V4_ENABLE_MOCK_HAL, V4_OPTIMIZE_SIZE)

## [0.2.1] - 2025-10-27

### Fixed
- Memory leaks in test cases where word names were not properly freed
- Critical: vm_destroy now properly frees word names allocated by vm_register_word

## [0.2.0] - 2025-10-27

### Added
- Return stack operations (TOR, FROMR, RFETCH)
- Word dictionary and CALL opcode for function calls
- New error types: InvalidArg, DictionaryFull, InvalidWordIdx
- vm_register_word and vm_get_word API functions
- vm_exec function for executing word entries
- Word name field for debugging and REPL support
- Stack inspection APIs: vm_ds_depth_public and vm_ds_peek_public

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: vm_register_word now accepts optional name parameter
- **BREAKING**: Word structure now includes name field
- Fixed stack helpers to return errors correctly
